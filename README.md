## 3lb Undercutter Combat Robot

This repository contains the complete mechanical design and structural validation of a 3lb (1.36 kg) horizontL combat robot developed for competitive robotics events.

The bot is designed with a low center-of-mass architecture, belt-driven horizontal spinner, and FEA-validated chassis optimized for impact resistance and weight efficiency.

## KEY FEATURES

Horizontal spinner weapon system

Belt-driven transmission

Lightweight, FEA-optimized top and bottom plates

Reinforced weapon support structure

Modular internal layout for quick maintenance

Symmetrical drivetrain for stability


## ENGINEERING APPROACH

Designed in Fusion 360

Static stress analysis performed on:

Top plate

Weapon support arm

Motor mounts

Shape optimization to reduce weight while maintaining structural stiffness

Considered dynamic effects from high-RPM weapon loading


## DESIGN OBJECTIVES

Stay within 3lb weight constraint

Maximize weapon energy under motor limitations

Ensure structural integrity under impact loads

Maintain low center of gravity

Enable quick serviceability between matches


## TOOLS USED

CAD: Fusion 360

Simulation: Fusion 360 FEA (Static & Dynamic)

Fabrication: CNC-machined + custom components
